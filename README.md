# Personal-Loan-Campaign 

## Data Description
- The dataset contains 5000 customers of AllLife Bank, a US bank that has a growing customer base. The majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying sizes of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors).
### Component of the Personal-Loan-Campaign
- This project is about how to build a model that will help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.
### Training the Machine Learning Model
- I recommend that you create a python3 virtual environment, run the command and activate it
1. Launch the jupyter notebook
2. Install and import the required packages
3. Before training the model, I select the label from the features
4. Split the data into training data and test data
5. Scale the training data to have the mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1
6. Next is to train the model.
7. Evaluate the model performance using the metrics from scikit-learn
8. Lastly carry out the validation using the test data.
9. Try different model with the algorithm optimisation
10. Correct data imbalance using SMOTE and evaluate model performance again.
### Conclusion
Gradient Boosting Classifier with 98% on the training data and 97% on the test data will be deployed. This means 97% of the time, the model will correctly predict the liability
customers that will buy personal loans.
